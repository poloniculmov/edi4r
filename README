= EDI TOOLKIT for RUBY (edi4r)

This is Ruby gem <b>edi4r</b> version 
:include:VERSION

Edi4r was created to greatly simplify the creation and processing of data 
for Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). In particular, it supports the
UN/EDIFACT syntax (ISO 9573) and optionally SAP IDocs. 
Limited support is offered for ANSI X.12 and SEDAS.
 
== Installation

Install it as any other Ruby gem, e.g.:

  sudo gem install edi4r-<version>.gem

With administrator privileges and network access, just type:

  gem install edi4r


== Usage

  require 'edi4r'         # Older installations: require_gem 'edi4r'
  require 'edi4r/edifact' # optional

  # Build a UN/EDIFACT interchange from its character representation in a file:
  
  ic = nil
  File.open("received.edi") {|hnd| ic = EDI::E::Interchange.parse( hnd ) }
  ic.each do |msg|
    # Process message, here: Just list document numbers from (only) segment BGM
    puts msg['BGM'].first.d1004
  end

  # Create a minimalistic interchange

  ic  = EDI::E::Interchange.new  # Default: syntax version=3, charset = UNOB
  msg = ic.new_message           # Default: ORDERS D.96A

  bgm = msg.new_segment('BGM')   # Obtain an empty segment
  bgm.cC002.d1001 = '220'	 # Add some content to mandatory elements
  bgm.d1004 = 'PO-54321'
  dtm = msg.new_segment('DTM')
  dtm.cC507.d2005 = '137'
  uns = msg.new_segment('UNS')
  uns.d0081 = 'S'
  [bgm, dtm, uns].each {|seg| msg.add seg} # Add segments to message
  ic.add msg                     # Add message to interchange - ready to go!

  ic.header.cS002.d0004 = 'sender'; ic.header.cS003.d0010 = 'recipient' # UNB
  ic.validate # Conforming to standard?
  print ic    # Could be sent that way!
